Tutorials
=========

The tutorials last for two days and are a unique training opportunity for
beginner or trained scientists. The tutorials range from array manipulations
with numPy to intensive parallele computation. Consider coming for the
tutorials and staying for the scientific track or the opposite!

Beginners
---------

The beginner tutorial are intended to scientists and engineers who are familiar
with and basic programming and numerical computing. The tutorials assume the
audience has some previous experience with a scientific-computing software
(Matlab, Scilab, Octave, etc.) and is comfortable with basic numerical
computing in these environments. No prior programming experience with Python is
expected. However, attendees are strongly encouraged to go through the official
Python tutorial before attending the Introductory Tutorial.

**Objectives**

At the end of the course participants will be able to write reasonable quality,
procedural python programs broadly exposed to several of the relevant Python
packages for numerical computing like

* ipython (interactive data exploration)
* numpy (arrays)
* scipy (numerics)
* matplotlib (high quality 2D plotting)

in order to write code for typical scientific computing tasks involving
numerical algorithms, data analysis, data exploration and visualization.
understand the general tools, workflow and best practices involved in writing
good quality, python programs for scientific computing.

**Structure of tutorial**

The course will be completely hands on. All of the lecture material will expect
users to type along and the sessions will be punctuated with exercises. The
solutions for these exercises will also be discussed.

**Pre-requisites**

Attendees are expected to bring along their laptops fully setup with the
necessary software. We suggest installing Python(x,y) or EPD. If you install
Python(x,y) be sure to install the Full Edition which includes the Advanced
Python Modules. The various software required are:

* Python, version 2.7 or above,
* numpy, version 1.4 or above
* scipy, version 0.9 or above
* IPython, version 0.10 or above
* matplotlib, version 1.0 or above


Advanced
--------
Advanced tutorials are intended at scientists and engineers who already have
experience in scientific computing with Python. They cover in-depth specific
tools and projects, aimed at experienced users and presented by leading experts
of the topic
