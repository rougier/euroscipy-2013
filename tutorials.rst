Tutorials
=========

The tutorials last for two days and are a unique training opportunity for
beginner or trained scientists. The tutorials range from array manipulations
with numPy to intensive parallele computation. Consider coming for the
tutorials and staying for the scientific track or the opposite!

Beginners
---------
The beginner tutorial are intended to scientists and engineers who are familiar
with and basic programming and numerical computing. The tutorials assume the
audience has some previous experience with a scientific-computing software
(Matlab, Scilab, Octave, etc.) and is comfortable with basic numerical
computing in these environments. No prior programming experience with Python is
expected. However, attendees are strongly encouraged to go through the official
Python tutorial before attending the Introductory Tutorial.

Advanced
--------
Advanced tutorials are intended at scientists and engineers who already have
experience in scientific computing with Python. They cover in-depth specific
tools and projects, aimed at experienced users and presented by leading experts
of the topic
